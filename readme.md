 # ANDI - Accessible Name and Description Inspector 
 
 ANDI is an accessibility test tool used by web authors and testers to inspect web content for accessibility.
  
## ANDI provides a means with which to evaluate:
1.	Automatically detected accessibility issues
2.	Suggested accessibility warnings
3.	The accessible names and descriptions of interactive elements

## What makes ANDI so darn dandy?

Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web. For web authors, accessibility is often an unfamiliar territory. ANDI bridges the gap between developers and end users of web applications by revealing where accessibility issues occur on the page. To accomplish this, it analyzes and manipulates the HTML DOM of the web page being testing looking for accessibility related markup.
	
### Developers like ANDI because: 
* It quickly and automatically makes technical suggestions to improve accessibility.
	
### Testers like ANDI because: 
* It saves them huge amounts of time by automatically finding defects and offering solutions.
	
### End Users Ultimately Benefit:
* When web pages are accessible, EVERYONE can efficiently perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web.

## Sounds handy! How do I install ANDI?

ANDI is a browser based "favelet" that, essentially, installs with a drag and drop, and is launched with the click of a button. Users can visit this [installation page](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/install.html) for browser installation instructions. If an organization wishes to host its own copy of ANDI, it should be hosted on a web server that supports secure ssh transfer in order to be used in chrome and firefox to test https pages. Internet Explorer does not currently enforce such restrictions. See this page for instructions on how to [modify the favelet launch script](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/install.html#launchscript) to point to a different source.
     
## How can I sweeten ANDI's candy? 
 
If you would like to contribute to ANDI's development, some background knowledge of accessibility would certainly be helpful. ANDI is written in javascript, jquery, html, and CSS. Knowledge of javascript optimization and DOM manipulation is crucial to maintaining ANDI's quick agility. On ANDI's TODO list are a few feature enhancements: Look for "TODO" in the code.

## I'm ready to drink the brandy. Who maintains ANDI?

ANDI is maintained by the Accessible Solutions Branch as SSA.
